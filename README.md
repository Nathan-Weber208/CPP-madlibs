I started this project to learn how to code in C++. I had an old Mad gabs assighnemt in python and thought it would be a good bite sized project to learn.

This project is a little different as my first project just asked for inputs and spat them back. I added some stretch goals to have the program ask you your answer and if you diddnt answer, just put some random words in for you.

This program was coded in VS code and uses CSV files full of most common Adjectives, Animals, First and Last names, Interjections, and Verbs.

# Future Work

I need to work out the kinks in the stretch goals. you may notice that it doesnt actually make a random choice or the CVS files. its just the last one.

I also want to try what i origionally wanted to try on this project and make a sudoku game.

C++ is a fun program and i want to learn to be competent enough to have a job with it.
